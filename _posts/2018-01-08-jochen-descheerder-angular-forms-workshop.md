On the 7th of December 2017 Ordina gave me the chance to attend the Angular Master Class, given by Pascal Precht and Dominic Elm from Thoughtram. 
A few days before the conference, we all received an e-mail with some instructions to set up a starting project for the course. Nothing major, just clone a Git repository, do a little bit of configuration and we should be ready to go the next day!

Or not… As always there were a few individuals who didn’t go through the setup and delayed the whole class. After half an hour of waiting, we were all ready to roll. Well, at least for the time being.
For the biggest part, our group consisted of people who already had some experience with Angular. According to the instructors, not a necessity, but in retrospect a most welcome bonus.

The content itself was split up in several small topics. For each topic, the instructors went over a few theoretical slides answering questions - if we had any - in the process. After that, we got the time to complete a hands-on exercise on our own, again with the possibility to yell for help when needed.

More in detail, the Master Class covered two major blocks regarding Angular Forms:
* **Template-driven** - Everything we need to build forms declaratively
* **Reactive** - Enables testing forms, reactive data-flow and thinner markup

The exercises guided us through the implementation of the well-known CRUD actions in an existing “contacts-list” application. The first few assignments covered template-driven forms and basic validation. After the lunch break, this template-driven forms example would be refactored to use reactive forms.
			
On top of that, the course also covered different areas of form validation, along with the creation of custom async validators and custom form controls. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the difficulty rises quickly throughout the different tasks. As stated above, any previous experience with Angular will be of great help when enrolling for this class. Even though Pascal & Dominic are very good at what they do and try their utmost best in helping you to solve any problem during the assignments.

In the end, this one-day excursion through the implementation and usage of Angular Forms and validators has been a great learning experience for me. If you have an existing Angular-background and would like to extend this knowledge, this might just be something for you, too!
