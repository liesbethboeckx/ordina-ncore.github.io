        "content": "On the 7th of December 2017 Ordina gave me the chance to attend the Angular Master Class, given by Pascal Precht and Dominic Elm from Thoughtram. A few days before the conference, we all received an email with some instructions to set up a starting project for the course. Nothing major, just clone a Git repository, do a little bit of configuration and we should be ready to go the next day!Or not… As always there were a few individuals who didn’t go through the setup and delayed the whole class. After half an hour of waiting, we were all ready to roll. Well, at least for the time being.For the biggest part, our group consisted of people who already had some experience with Angular. According to the instructors, not a necessity, but in retrospect a most welcome bonus.The content itself was split up in several small topics. For each topic, the instructors went over a few theoretical slides answering questions - if we had any - in the process. After that, we got the time to complete a hands-on exercise on our own, again with the possibility to ask for help when needed.More in detail, the Master Class covered two major blocks regarding Angular Forms:  Template-driven - Everything we need to build forms declaratively  Reactive - Enables testing forms, reactive data-flow and thinner markupThe exercises guided us through the implementation of the well-known CRUD actions in an existing “contacts-list” application. The first few assignments covered template-driven forms and basic validation. After the lunch break, this template-driven forms example would be refactored to use reactive forms.On top of that, the course also covered different areas of form validation, along with the creation of custom async validators and custom form controls.One thing to keep in mind is that the difficulty rises quickly throughout the different tasks. As stated above, any previous experience with Angular will be of great help when enrolling for this class. Even though Pascal &amp; Dominic are very good at what they do and try their utmost best in helping you to solve any problem during the assignments.In the end, this one-day excursion through the implementation and usage of Angular Forms and validators has been a great learning experience for me. If you have an existing Angular-background and would like to extend this knowledge, this might just be something for you, too!        "

        "content": "The first day of a journey will always be remembered. On august 1st over 40 open minded and enthusiastic kickstarters embarked on a journey into the unknown. A journey filled with mountains to climb and rivers to cross. The big kickstarter group sprouted a team of 6 dedicated travelers with as destination the N-Core unit. As we travelled along we filled our bags with knowledge and experience guided by our coaches and managers. After almost 2 months we reached our destination, changed our clothes and re-embarked on a new development journey.Table of Contents  First impressions  Set-up  Topics  Group  Conclusion1. First impressionsWe’ve all heard the phrase, “you never get a second chance to make a first impression”. Never is that more true than on an employee’s first day on the job. Nonetheless our first day started with a warm welcome at the Ordina headquarters. All 43 kickstarters gathered in the lounge where we met and had a drink.After chitchatting around with some kickstarters, Ordina gave us a pleasant tour around the building. A brief explanation of every floor and the utilization of it was given by our mentors. We even had a look into our CEOs office and a chance to talk to him! The fun didn’t stop here, briskly after our tour we were presented with a brand new car key and laptop! As everybody took the car keys we walked outside to take a look at our brand new cars! The atmosphere was really enjoyable and everybody was delighted. Later on we had some food and enjoyed the company of our awesome colleagues.The Ordina building, people and atmosphere made everyone congenial, this resulted in a wonderful impression!2. Set-upThere is no room for amateurism in Ordina. Instructors had to be on top of their courses and no less than a senior consultant was accepted to guide us through the path of knowledge. We took a dive deep into many topics, including, but not limited to, C#, ASP.NET, Databases, XAML, Angular, Git, Xamarin, etc. Next to technical skills, soft skills cannot be ignored as a consultant. Not only did we receive fully fledged out communication trainings, tips and tricks were scattered around every single training where every instructor could convey their own insight to us.The sheer volume of the training in a timespan of merely 2 months meant that the we could not afford to go slow. Every day, multiple topics were discussed and practiced on. Almost every day we had the possibility to check our progress with a test where most returned with a positive result.While the tempo was high and the courses plenty, the ambiance was not sacrificed at all. Having a good dynamic within the group, our instructors did not fail to entertain. While learning was the primary goal, having fun was most certainly second.3. TopicsThese were the topics we handled:  OOP/C#/Visual Studio  C# advanced topics  Database best practices  Entity Framework  HTML/CSS/JS basics /Debugging  Advanced JS + TypeScript + Web build  Angular  MVC 5 &amp; MVC Core  WebAPI and WCF  XAML (UWP+WPF)  Unit Testing  Agile/SCRUM  TFVC and Git  Xamarin (Forms)  Backlog refinement + sprint planning dev case  Communication Training  Brand yourself4. GroupAs mentioned before, having fun was just as important as work! We are facing each other 8 hours a day. So team spirit is a big thing. Since the first day we met there was a connection. We laughed and told some interesting stories about ourselves on our first day at Ordina. Through the studies, we helped each other out and nobody was left behind. Nobody minded to give some extra explanation after the hours or to repeat the same thing a million times. To give a conclusion about the group we can give you a few characteristics about our group. We love to have fun, love to life and love to program.5. ConclusionWith an open mind we started our Kickstarter training. In this training of several weeks we founded our way at Ordina and learned a lot of new things or had a great repetition in several topics as listed above. At Ordina there is an excellent atmosphere to work.Afterwards we can say that the Kickstarter training was a good start on our new/first job and we can recommend the training to other developers who would like to have a new/first challenge."

        "content": "For a couple of years, I hear colleagues talking about NDC Oslo. For most of them, NDC is one of -if not THE- best developer conferences out there. This led to the fact that, to me, this conference has this superior status.A few years ago, I went twice to NDC London and as the hopes were high, I was a little disappointed eventually. Not that it was bad or anything, maybe my expectations were just a little bit too high. But back then, I found that the mix of topics wasn’t 100% to me..This year, however, I finally got the opportunity to go to the mother of all (NDC) conferences: NDC Oslo. Would it transcend the London-experience? Or would it even meet my original expectations I once had about the NDC Conference?And it all started Wednesday 14th June with Dylan Beattie’s keynote “Are there any questions”. That was one nice and easily digestible keynote! Fortunately it wasn’t too heavy because I think most of the attendees were already stuffed with the delicious breakfast that was being served! - Oooh, look, in one of my first sentences of this post about NDC I’m already talking about food…The rest of this first day was packed with lots of great sessions! Like for example “Creating a .NET renaissance” about how .NET community leaders should create a renaissance of the framework and technology stack that we love in order to keep it hip, cool and alive. Also, the session “Serverless - reality or BS - notes from the trenches” was interesting to hear about the experiences of somebody who has already built a lot of real production serverless systems instead of only the cool demo-stuff. Moreover, it was very fascinating to see how this can be done on both Azure, Amazon and Google Cloud. For many devs, when they hear ‘functional programming’, they immediately think about programming languages like F# of Scala. The session “Functional techniques for C#” just showed how versatile the great C# programming language truly is. Saw a lot of great concepts and patterns in this session! And then, of course, there is a session called “C# 7”, given by John Skeet… And that is actualy all you need to know to realize that this was an awesome session.The second day of the conference started off with the best “What is .NET Standard” session I’ve ever seen: clear and simple, just like .NET standard itself! Sessions like “Why I’m not leaving .NET” and “Brave New .NET” clearly stipulated why .NET is still a very solid and alive platform that is ready for the future! At a development conference, not all sessions have to be technical. Like “Optimism and the Growth Mindset” by Reginald Braithwaite. He talked about Dr. Martin Seligman’s work on “Optimism” and how this changed his life. A fantastic and inspirational talk!On the last day of the conference, I only had time for 2 sessions (stupid flight schedules!) but these were 2 nice sessions to close the NDC conference for me: “Building Connected &amp; Disconnected Mobile Apps” by James Montemagno and “Beyond step-by step debugging in Visual Studio” by Tess Ferrandez. I was amazed by how fluently she was using WinDbg to find the culprit of a crash in an application. She made WinDbg look easy to use…. Both of these sessions were great, given by two awesome speakers. I had the chance to talk to both James and Tess during the conference, really nice people!And besides all these sessions, there was of course the party at Thursday night. The band “Love Shack” rocked the Oslo Spektrum with songs from the 80’s, including Brian Adams, Metallica, Depeche Mode, … Fan-tas-tic!And did I mention anything about the food at NDC? Yes, I did actually already in one of the first sentences… But still I want to point out that the food was marvelous! From the early morning until the last sessions, there was food being served constantly!So did NDC Oslo live up to the expectations? Yes! Yes, it did! What a great conference! Well organized, good sessions, good mix of topics, great speakers, awesome food, the ‘overflow room’ where you can go to if you can’t choose between multiple sessions (all sessions are streamed live on a large screen and you get an audio device on which you can choose from what session you want the audio),… I truly hope I can go back to NDC next year! (I know you are reading this, Jörgen*)*Jörgen: my manager… ;-)By the way, all the session (or at leat most of them) can be viewed online. Those that I pointed out in this post are really worthwhile to watch!"

        "content": "  When my boss offered me to go to the GOTO conference, I eagerly accepted. It’s one of the most reputable developer conferences in the neighborhood, with a steady following. I must say, the reputation is well earned.I arrived in sunny shiny busy Amsterdam after a long 3 hour drive with my co-worker. We had to leave very early in the morning to arrive on time despite unpredictable traffic. Once we saw the awesome conference venue, the Beurs van Berlage, all fatigue left our bodies and we went in to join the hubbub of like-minded people inside. The welcoming and distribution of ticket pendants was very well organized, and a healthy breakfast was provided in the common area. Immediately we got to talking with professional colleagues about what tracks looked interesting and how we would apply them once we got back to the dailies.A big gong sounded the start of the first session, and what a kick-off session it was. The renowned Chris Valasek from the Uber company talked us through the current state of automotive security. Mr Valasek is a highly energetic speaker, and I’m sure that if the morning coffee hadn’t done its job, he would have. The unfamiliarity of the topic made it all the more intriguing to me. After that, it was time to make some hard, definitive choices about which sessions to follow.The subtitle of the conference was “Digital Transformation, Privacy &amp; Security”, a good choice given the available tracks:•\tCloud native•\tUnhackable•\tIT &amp; society•\tMachine learning without a PhD•\tSolutions tuesdayI went mostly for sessions along the unhackable track, and these are my highlights:Adrian Mouat – Applied microservices securityWell, maybe a better title would have been ‘applied docker security’, but it was still a great talk. Mr Mouat pointed out a bunch of easy ways to better your docker security in small steps. He laid them out very clear, and I picked up a high density of quick wins.Dan North – How to break the rulesI think everyone who has seen him talk can agree that Dan North is a great captivating speaker, no matter the subject. Unfortunately this translated in a quite overfilled room. Even though there were no more chairs, I decided to stay and listen, and I’m glad I did. Mr North clarified what you need to do to make a digital transformation succeed, and what questions to ask before you commit to one. I’m convinced every manager should see this talk, I definitely learned some lessons.Jaya Baloo – Surveillance and cryptographyOne of the few female speakers, but a superb talk. With every sentence I was more and more convinced that Mrs Baloo knew very well what she was talking about. She sketched the future of cryptography so compelling and well-informed, I felt as if I had lived it. It was pretty scary though.Social eventAfter day one, we all gathered in special place nearby: Bar Heffer. Yes, there was alcohol, but the sense of camaraderie and the willingness to help each other brought out the best in all present. We had great discussion about microservices and async patterns, chatted with speakers, learned about other cultures (visit a Polish wedding!). I’m sure I’m not the only one who made new friends there. Who knew developers could be so social?Poorna Kallare - Internet of healthcare thingsNot an experienced speaker, but definitely one to touch on some key benefits of a microservices architecture I had not contemplated yet, all in the context of high-quality medical software practical use-cases.Ben Stopford – Rethinking microservices with stateful streamsI’ve never done stateful streams before, but the talk by Mr Stopford was an open invitation to look into them. He showed a practical implementation with Kafka that seemed like a really nice architecture. I do have to learn more about this topic.Anyways, it was a wonderful conference, and they do have some nice free and publicly available sessions online, do check it out: https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences"

        "content": "  Like every year Ordina Belgium gives a lot of their consultants the opportunity to attend Techorama. This year Ordina offered nachos at their booth for all the hungry developers ;). After attending a session about Angular Forms, given by Deborah Kurata, I was thinking about how we could improve our nachos service next year. Maybe we should allow people to order nachos in advance, by using a web-application based on Angular forms.Most of the current web applications, contain at least 1 form. A large category of frontend applications are very form-intensive, especially in the case of enterprise development. Many of these applications are basically just huge forms. Before we start building our order-application it might be interesting to know the different approaches that can be used while working with Angular Forms.Different approachesAngular provides two ways to work with forms: template-driven forms and reactive forms. With template-driven forms, the default way to work with forms in Angular, template directives are used to build an internal representation of the form. With reactive forms, we build our own representation of a form in the component class.Let’s start by using template-driven forms and see how far we get.Template-driven formsWe will first focus on the template-driven approach. The first step we need to take is enabling the Angular Forms API.Import FormsModuleIn order to use Angular forms we need to import Angular’s FormsModule, who can be found in the @angular/forms module, into our application module (AppModule.ts).import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';@NgModule({  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule],  declarations: [AppComponent],  bootstrap: [AppComponent]})export AppModule {}Creating the formWe first need to create a component. This can be done quickly by using the angular-cli.    ng generate component order-formNow we can start creating our form layout in the component html file.    &lt;form (ngSubmit)=\"sendOrder()\"&gt;         ...        &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Order&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/form&gt;When Angular finds a form it will automatically been seen as a ngForm directive. This is because the ngForm directive has a selector matching &lt;form&gt;. The ngForm directive tells Angular to create a FormGroup and bind it to the form. The FormGroup will track the state and values of the form.Our form is using the ngSubmit directive. ngSubmit ensures that the form does not submit, when the handler code throws and causes an actual http post request.Template-reference variablesNow that we have a form and a submit button I would like to disable the submit button when the form is not valid, by checking the valid property of the ngForm instance. To access the ngForm instance we need to export the reference and import it into a template-reference variable. A Template-reference variable is prefixed by a #. Here we export the ngForm into a the #orderForm template-reference variable. Now we can disable the submit button when our ngForm is not valid.    &lt;form #orderForm=\"ngForm\"          (ngSubmit)=\"sendOrder(orderForm)\"&gt;         ...        &lt;button type=\"submit\" [disabled]=\"!orderForm.valid\"&gt;Order&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/form&gt;Adding input elementsA form does not make a lot of sense when it does not contain any input fields. So this will be our next step.    ...        &lt;input id=\"inputFirstName\"               type=\"text\"               required               [(ngModel)]=\"order.firstName\"               name=\"firstName\"               #firstNameVar=\"ngModel\"/&gt;            ...The ngModel directive will setup two-way binding between the component-class property and the view. Angular automatically creates a FormControl and adds it to the form model, for each input-element with a ngModel directive. The name attribute is required, without it Angular would not know how to name the FormControl within the form-model.By using a template-reference variable #firstNameVar we can access the FormControl on another location, within the current template.ValidationTemplate-driven forms leverage the HTML validation attributes for validation. By using *ngIf the errors property, of an input element, can be checked and an appropriate error message can be displayed.    ...        &lt;input id=\"inputFirstName\"               type=\"text\"               required               [(ngModel)]=\"order.firstName\"               name=\"firstName\"               #firstNameVar=\"ngModel\"/&gt;        &lt;span style=\"color: red\" [hidden]=\"firstNameVar.valid || !firstNameVar.touched\"&gt;            &lt;small *ngIf=\"firstNameVar.errors &amp;&amp; firstNameVar.errors.required\"&gt;Please enter your first name&lt;/small&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;    ...Angular provides us a subset of built-in validators out of the box. We can apply them either declaratively as directives on elements in our DOM.Reactive formsLet’s see how much effort we need to refactor our template-driven form into a reactive or model-driven one. When taking the reactive form approach we will define the form-model by creating the FormGroup and the form instance our self, in our component-class. After this we’ll bind the template to our form model. This means that the form won’t be modifying our data model directly.Import ReactiveFormsModuleFirst thing we need to do is loading the correct module. To be able to use Reactive form directives we need to import Angular’s ReactiveFormsModule, whichUpdaexport AppModule {}Refactor the component classLet’s start refactoring. In the template-driven part we saw that Angular, behind the scenes, creates a FormGroup for each form it encounters. We’ll start by creating our form model by initializing a FormGroup. The best place to initialize the form is in the ngOnInit() method, who is one of the lifecycle hook methods that is called shortly after the creation of our component.import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import { FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';import { Order } from '../models/order';@Component({  selector: 'app-reactive',  ...})export class ReactiveComponent implements OnInit {  orderForm: FormGroup;  order: Order;  ...  ngOnInit() {    this.orderForm = new FormGroup();  }  ...}Great we now have a form, but it’s an empty one. So the next step will be to add a FormControl for each input element.import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';import { Order } from '../models/order';@Component({  selector: 'app-reactive',  ...})export class ReactiveComponent implements OnInit {  orderForm: FormGroup;  order: Order;  ...  ngOnInit() {    this.orderForm = new FormGroup({      firstName: new FormControl(''),      lastName: new FormControl(''),      mySauce: new FormControl('chili')    });  ...}By passing a value to the first parameter, of the FormControl constructor, we can set default values.Linking to the templateAfter defining our form and its controls, in the component class, we need to link it with our template.    &lt;form [formGroup]=\"orderForm\"          (ngSubmit)=\"sendOrder()\"&gt;    ...    &lt;/form&gt;This can be done by using the formGroup directive, who will connect our model with the form template.The next thing we need to do is connect all the form controls to the model.    &lt;form [formGroup]=\"orderForm\"          (ngSubmit)=\"sendOrder()\"&gt;        &lt;label for=\"inputFirstName\"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;    &lt;input id=\"inputFirstName\"                type=\"text\"                required                formControlName=\"firstName\"/&gt;    ...    &lt;/form&gt;We replaced the combination of an ngModel and name attribute, like in template-driven forms, by a single formControlName directive. The formControlName directive will make the association between the form controls and the model.Accessing the From Model propertiesWhen using template-driven forms we could make usage of template-reference variables to access form objects somewhere else in the template. Reactive forms requires another approach.    &lt;form [formGroup]=\"orderForm\"          (ngSubmit)=\"sendOrder()\"&gt;            &lt;label for=\"inputFirstName\"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;        &lt;input id=\"inputFirstName\"            type=\"text\"            required            formControlName=\"firstName\"/&gt;        &lt;span style=\"color: red\" *ngIf=\"(orderForm.get('firstName').touched &amp;&amp; !orderForm.get('firstName').valid)\"&gt;            &lt;small *ngIf=\"orderForm.get('firstName').errors.required\"&gt;Please enter your first name&lt;/small&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;    ...    &lt;/form&gt;By using orderForm.get('firstName') we are requesting the firstName FormControl of our main FormGroup.ValidationThere are different ways to add validation, when using reactive forms, we can either add them as directives to the template or to the FormControl instance in our model.We will add the validations directly to the FormControl.    ...        &lt;label for=\"inputFirstName\"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;        &lt;input id=\"inputFirstName\"               type=\"text\"               formControlName=\"firstName\"/&gt;    ...First we need to remove the required attribute from our template.import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms';import { Order } from '../models/order';@Component({  selector: 'app-reactive',  ...})export class ReactiveComponent implements OnInit {  orderForm: FormGroup;  order: Order;  ...  ngOnInit() {    this.orderForm = new FormGroup({      firstName: new FormControl('', Validators.required),      lastName: new FormControl('', Validators.required),      mySauce: new FormControl('chili')    });  }  ...When more than one validator is needed an array of validators can be passed.SummaryThis was a very quick intro to Angular Forms and it’s only a tip of the iceberg. We can do a lot more with forms but the intention was to give an overview about basic funtionality that we use day in and day out when working with forms.Here is a small overview of both ways:            Template-driven      Reactive                  Easy to use      Flexibel              Similar to AngularJs      More code              2-way data binding      Immutable data model              Automatic tracking of state      Easier to test, because everything is in code      The code, used during this blog post, can be found on github."

        "content": "  As every year, Ordina Belgium sends a whole bunch of consultants to Techorama. After all, we are – together with Microsoft – Ultimate partner of this great event.In this blogpost, I’ll briefly summarize my overall thoughts of this event and I’ll go deeper into some things I’ve picked up from some sessions.OverallFirst of all: the event itself. This year was the first year that it was being held in Antwerp, instead of Mechelen. This was necessary due to the fact that the venue in Mechelen was simply becoming too small to handle the number of visitors (1400!!). Even in such a big venue, it sometimes felt a bit crowdy in the Partner Expo, especially during lunch. But, even that was no real biggy: the weather was great so once we had our food, we could go outside and enjoy the sun. Is it just me, or is the weather always great during Techorama? About the food: it was GREAT: Belgian fries (what else?), Deluxe burger, pappardelle, meatloaf, BBQ sausage, Beef curry, pizza, Belgian waffles, … It reminded me a lot of NDC! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a true compliment!The sessions in general were of very good quality. Of course, they can’t all be at the same level. There were a few sessions that weren’t as favorable as others… I’m not saying they were bad, not at all! But I guess at some point you just get a bit spoiled with speakers like Scott Guthrie, Marcel De Vries, Shawn Wildermuth, Donovan Brown, Kasey Uhlenhuth, … First world problems! 😊Session takeawaysI’ve seen a lot of great session this year. And there are a few things that stayed with me that I would like to share.Azure: The intelligent Cloud (Scott Guthrie)  Microsoft is all-in on Azure.  90% of the fortune 500 uses Azure.  Azure stack is the ideal solution for companies that -for whatever reason- don’t want to run their code or host their data in the public cloud.  Azure stack is the ideal solution for situations where there is no guarantee of an internet connection, so you run Azure on your own hardware.  Xamarin Live Player looks great! It will definitely speed up development of Xamarin apps (although I think Scott had another version running than I have, because I didn’t get any further than a few exceptions yet… 😉)  Cosmos DB is great for when you want to replicate your data around the globe, bringing it as close to your users as you can.  The Gu can get UI tests working in Visual Studio Mobile Center (I don’t… )  The Gu knows how to close VIM!Containerized Delivery with Visual Studio Team Services and Docker (Rene van Osnabrugge)Note: Yes, I am a Docker-n00b. So, this session was literally my introduction into Docker.  This container thing looks nice and promising.  Prepare a Docker image and easily distribute it to anybody you want (via DockerHub or Azure Docker Registry) so they can easily and instantly can start playing Super Mario Bros. (or do anything else on it for that matter 😉)  Need a SQL server to test some stuff =&gt; download and run Docker image in just a couple of seconds.  Deliver your application -together with everything that is needed to run it- on a container. Productivity++, ITProHapiness++, DevHapiness++  CD pipeline becomes a lot simpler!Architecting systems for Continuous Delivery (Marcel De Vries)  Monoliths = tightly-coupled, multi-tier, software.  We know monoliths are a bad thing, so we started to use SOA some years ago.  In most cases, SOA based architectures are still a monolith…  … even worse; they are a distributed monolith.  It’s about time to really break our monoliths in smaller, independent pieces.  These pieces are vertical components/layers in your software, like Search or Recommendations, Shopping Cart, …  If you want to make this work, the whole company should be structured in these verticals (Conway’s law).  Every vertical should use the tools/frameworks that are best suited to deal with the problem. After all, as these verticals run independently, this will not affect any other verticals.  Every vertical can be developed on, built and released at its own pace without interfering with any other verticalsIntroduction to ASP.NET Core and Visual Studio 2017 (Shawn Wildermuth)Note: as a mobile developer, I haven’t worked with ASP.NET (MVC) for years. So, I was really excited to see how this product evolved over the years, especially now with .NET Core.  ASP.NET Core is not much at its core.  It won’t do any secret mumbo jumbo in a black box, everything is simple and transparent.  It doesn’t force you into anything. Want to manually write output to the browser (even no html or whatsoever)? You can! Want to use MVC? You can! You just need to install a few packages and add a minimum configuration code. Just want to serve a document? You can! Want to use webforms? YOU CAN’T! And that’s a good thing, you really should seek some help if you wanted to do this.  More transparent about which files will get distributed when publishing your site  Shawn doesn’t like Serif font… And don’t ask him about it, especially not when his wife is around…Microservices – But not like that (Udi Dahan)  I guess this session was like how Neo must have felt when he took the red pill…  Microservices are the next big thing after REST  But it is not the silver bullet, it won’t solve things like wrong requirements or bad processes.  It is very important to model the structure of the company when going for micoservices (Conway’s law).  Passing an id from one service to another (instead of the whole object) doesn’t make the system loosely coupled when both services connect to the same DB in the end.  Don’t try to fight things that just need to be done (adding a field to the DB and showing it on the screen will always require you to do some work on multiple levels/layers)  Every service should use the tools/frameworks that are best suited to deal with the problem.Reactive programming by Example (Peter Himschoot / Lander Verhack)  Reactive programming is like collections in an asynchronous way.  Very powerful!  Reactive Extension in .NET is a separate package that needs to be installed.  Might look easy to start with, but it tends to get very complex very fast when you are new to it.  Reactive programming is not there to solve only specific problems like Search, it can be used in a wide spectrum (but I guess you only see that when you have a good understanding of it)DevOps on the Microsoft Stack with Donovan Brown  Donovan Brown is a great guy! I talked to him before his session, he is a very nice guy to talk to.  He shares my opinion and pains about Visual Studio Mobile Center: it is a good start, but things like UI test should be fully integrated in the pipeline…  … the team is working hard on this (and other) features that will make Mobile Center great!  “DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.”  Why DevOps? Your competition is already doing it! If you don’t start now, you’ll never catch up!  Why DevOps? Increase velocity, reduce downtime, reduce human error.  DevOps on any platform, any technology =&gt; Microsoft supports it!.NET Code Style: code your way in Visual Studio 2017 (Kasey Uhlenhuth)  Kasey likes Belgian waffles!  DYK in America they have barbaric things like Hot Crispy Chicken waffles?  In Visual Studio 2017, in Tools, Options, Code Style menu, you can already define some preferences regarding code style.  You can also define an editorconfig in which you can define your preferred coding style. If you check this in in your source control system, contributors will also have these guides.  There is this thing called Kebap case? This-Is-Kebap-Case (see this pin going through my words?)  Already some things about code style are in Visual Studio 2017, there is many more to come in the coming updates.Techorama 2017 was great! Met a lot of great people at the conference and attended some great sessions!See you next year!!"

        "content": "  You have probably heard about the Blockchain, but how does it actually work on a technical basis?TopicsStep by step we will dive a little deeper into how the blockchain works:  Introduction  SHA256 Hash  Block  Blockchain  Distributed  Tokens  Coinbase  BitcoinIntroductionWhat is the blockchain?  Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or decentralized database that keeps permanent records of digital transactions.A blockchain exists out of multiple machines, called nodes. All the nodes store the same copy of digital transaction data.Transactions are bundled and concantenated into a block before being distributed to all the nodes.There is no central authority that is responsible for the transactions, all the nodes combined decide if they append it to the existing chain of blocks.The stored data is permanent or immutable, meaning data can only be added and if some mistake was made it cannot be undone. If you did made a mistake your only option is to compensate for it. A distributed database means that we do not have control over the data, we need to prevent others from tampering with the data. Especially when we read that it is a ledger for digital transactions, the data needs to be integer.Apart from that the blockchain needs protection from repudiation attacks. A repudiation attack is the possibility for a person to deny that they performed a specific action.Now let us go dive into some more detail.SHA256 Hash        &nbsp;In order to prevent tampering with the data we need some sort of validation. A hash or more specific a cryptographic hash function maps data from an arbitrary size to a fixed size. Such a function is also called a non-ivertible or a one-way function. The input will always generate the same output but you cannot figure out the input from the output, hence the term one-way. Sha256 is a hashing algorithm with an output of 256 bits or 64 hexadecimal characters. A Hexadecimal character uses 4 bits per character: 256/4=64        The hash for ncore will always be the same. Even an empty value has a hash value.        Let's take a very long Lorem Ipsum and see what happens        The hash has always the same length no matter the input.BlockCreating just a hash from some input is not very complicated and has no real added value. Where the added value comes from is that there is a constraint. The constraint makes it harder to create a hash. When we look at the constraint from Bitcoin today we will see that the all the hashes have 16 leading 0’s.Given some input we get an output, now we want to make the output more complicated therefore we need to add a nonce. For our example we add the constraint that the nonce should has 4 leading 0’s.        On an empty input everything is okay, now let’s find out what happens when we change the input to NCore.        The moment we changed the data to NCore the hash violated the constraint and became invalid. In order to fix this, we need to find a matching nonce. You can probably guess why there is a “Mine” button at the bottom.        BlockchainA blockchain is a chain of blocks. The current block takes the hash of the previous block. The chain breaks when you modify a value, this is exactly why they describe the blockchain as immutable. It is append only.        DistributedIf you had full control over the Blockchain it would only be a matter of time until you had altered an entry and cheated the system. Therefore the blockchain is also distributed; this means that there must be an agreement for every new entry. When you would try to modify something from the past the chain would be broken.        TokensUntil now we just had a data input area, without it being really useful. Let us introduce something that makes it interesting. Tokens are comparable with transferring money. At first we see the amount of dollars to be transformed and from who to whom.        CoinbaseBut there is still a problem at this stage. How do we start transferring money if nobody has money in his account. In this sample at block #1 100 dollar was added to the account of “Anders”. In block #2 we see that another 100 dollar was added. This gives a total of 200 dollar, however we need to deduct 60 dollar from it as we can see in the Transaction section.        BitcoinLet us look at a block of Bitcoin in detail and explain everything we see. The hash of block #125552 is: “00000000000000001e8d6829a8a21adc5d38d0a473b144b6765798e61f98bd1d”We see 2 transactions here, the first transaction is the coinbase. New money is added to the account of “15nNvBTUdMaiZ6d3GWCeXFu2MagXL3XM1q”. When we look at the second transaction, we see a combination of a coinbase and tokens. Account “1HuppjXz7dPrt2a67LqacDW5T4VanFrpqC” received 29,5 bitcoins and tranferred them to 2 seperate accounts.        "
